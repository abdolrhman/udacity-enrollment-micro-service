# Flask React Udacity Assessment

This is simple app for building out simple REST APIs. 
That consume udacity API for Courses 
With A React App to show Udacity Courses and Enroll to this courses
With A DUMMY USER


## Goal



## Usage

First start a postgres docker container and persist the data with a volume `flask-app-db`:

```
make start_dev_db
```

Then, start your virtual environment

```
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
Now, install the python dependencies and run the server:
```
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
(venv) $ python manage.py recreate_db
(venv) $ python manage.py runserver
```

To exit the virtual environment:
```
(venv) $ deactivate
$
```

#### Easier setup

I've created a makefile to make this entire process easier but purposely provided verbose instructions there to show you what is necessary to start this application. To do so:
```
$ make setup
```

If you like to destroy your docker postgres database and start over, run:
```
$ make recreate_db
```

### Folder Structure

- `api/views/` - As Like Controller Holds files that define your endpoints
- `api/models/` - Holds files that defines your database schema
- `api/__init__.py` - What is initially ran when you start your application
- `api/utils.py` - utility functions and classes -
- `api/core.py` - includes core functionality including error handlers and logger
- `api/wsgi.py` - app reference for gunicorn
- `tests/` - Folder holding tests

#### Others

- `config.py` - Provides Configuration for the application. There are two configurations: one for development and one for production using Heroku.
- `manage.py` - Command line interface that allows you to perform common functions with a command
- `requirements.txt` - A list of python package dependencies the application requires
- `Dockerfile` - instructions for Docker to build the Flask app
- `docker-compose.yml` - config to setup this Flask app and a Database
- `migrations/` - Holds migration files â€“ doesn't exist until you `python manage.py db init` if you decide to not use docker
